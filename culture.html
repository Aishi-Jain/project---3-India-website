                <p>The history of Indian culture extends over 4,500 years. The Vedic era, spanning from approximately 1700 BCE to 500 BCE, formed the groundwork for Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology, and literature. It also gave rise to numerous beliefs and rituals that persist to this day, such dh치rma, k치rma, y칩ga, and mok攷므. India is renowned for its religious diversity, with the main religions practiced there being Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism. Numerous historical schools of thought, such as those found in the Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and Buddhist philosophy, have influenced the prevalent religion, Hinduism.</p>
