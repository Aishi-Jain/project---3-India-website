                <p>In India, drapes were the most popular traditional garment to wear from antiquity till the contemporary era. It came in the shape of a sari for ladies, which was a single piece of fabric many yards long. Traditionally, the sari was draped over the shoulder and lower body. In the current version, it is tucked in the waist band for a more snug fit together with an underskirt, often known as an Indian petticoat. The end of the sari, which crosses over the shoulder, covers the midriff and hides the features of the upper body. It is also frequently worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which functions as the main upper-body garment. The dhoti, a shorter version of the same material, has been used as a lower body covering by men.</p>
