                <p>Plainly cooked cereal forms the basis of a normal Indian lunch, which is then enhanced with savory dishes that have a distinct taste. Steamed rice, chapati (a thin, unleavened bread made from wheat flour or sometimes cornmeal and fried on a griddle), idli (a steamed breakfast cake) and dosa (a griddled pancake prepared from a batter consisting of rice and gram meal) are some examples of cooked cereals. In accordance with culinary standards, the savory dishes may contain lentils, pulses, and vegetables that are typically spiced with ginger and garlic in addition to a variety of additional spices like coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, and others. They may also consist of beef, fish, or poultry meals. Sometimes, while the food is cooking, the components may be combined.</p>
